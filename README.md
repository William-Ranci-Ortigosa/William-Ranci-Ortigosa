Hi, I’m William. I’m interested in starting a career in Software Engineering.I'm currently a Senior in high school that is dual-enrolled with the local 
community college in Norwalk. I have created a few projects on my profile however I know I still have a lot to learn both in my technical skills and in the feild 
itself. I hope you will be able to help me in my journey!
