# William Ranci Ortigosa

Hi, I’m William and I'm interested in starting a career in Software Engineering. I'm currently a Senior in high school who is dual-enrolled in college. I have created a few projects here. However, I know I still have a lot to learn both in my technical skills and in the field itself. I hope you will be able to help me in my journey!
