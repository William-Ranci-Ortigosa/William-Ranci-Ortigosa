<h3>William Ranci Ortigosa - @William-Ranci-Ortigosa</h3>

Hi, I’m William and I'm interested in starting a career in Software Engineering. I'm currently a Senior in high school and excited to start my journey in the workforce. I have created a few projects here, however, I know I still have a lot to learn both in my technical skills and in the feild 
itself. I hope you will be able to help me in my journey!
